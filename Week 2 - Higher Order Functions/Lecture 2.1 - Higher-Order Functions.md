# Lecture 2.1 - Higher-Order Functions

### Higher order functions
+ Functions that either take other functions as parameters or return functions as results.
+ Provides a flexible way to compose programs.

        // Sum of all integers between a and b
        def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
          if (a > b) 0 else a + sumInts(a + 1, b)
        }

        // Sum of cubes of all integers between a and b
        def cube(a: Int): Int = a * a * a
        def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
          if (a > b) 0 else cube(a) + sumCubes(a + 1, b)
        }

        // Sum of factorials of all integers between a and b
        def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
          if (a > b) 0 else fact(a) + sumFactorials(a + 1, b)
        }

        These can be generalized as follows:
        `f(n) for all values of n between a and b`

        In Scala, it can be generalized as:

        def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
          if (a > b) 0
          else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)
        }

+ `f: Int => Int` is the way to define a function parameter
+ Generalising `sumInts`, `sumCubes` and `sumFactorials`

        def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(id, a, b)
        def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(cube, a, b)
        def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(fact, a, b)

        where

        def id(a: Int): Int = a
        def cube(a: Int): Int = a * a * a
        def fact(a: Int): Int = if (a == 0) 1 else a * fact(a - 1)

### Function Types
+ `A => B` is a function type. Stands for a function that takes type A and returns type B. Ex: `Int => Int` is the type of function.

### Anonymous functions
+ Passing functions as parameters usually leads to creation of smaller functions. Defining a name for each of these is tedious. Just like `def str = "Hello"; println(str)` is more tedious compared to `println("hello")`
  We could do that because strings exist as literals. Scala allows making functions as literals. These are called anonymous functions.
+ Syntax
  `(x: Int) => x * x * x`
  `(x: Int)` is the parameter of the function and `x * x * x` is it's body.
+ `sumInts`, `sumCubes` and `sumFactorials` using anonymous functions can be defined as:

        def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(x => x, a, b)
        def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(x => x * x * x, a, b)

+ Exercise: Replace the `sum` function as a tail recursive function
  Solution

        def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int, sumSoFar: Int): Int = {
          if (a > b) sumSoFar
          else sum(f, a + 1, b, f(a) + sumSoFar)
        }
