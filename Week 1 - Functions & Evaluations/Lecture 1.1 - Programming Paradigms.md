# Lecture 1.1 - Programming Paradigms

### Programming paradigms
+ Imperative programming
+ Functional programming
+ Logic programming
Object oriented programming is orthogonal to the above paradigms.

### Imperative programming
+ Involves modifying mutable variables, using assignments and control structures.

### Functional programming
+ In a stricter sense, FP means programming without mutable variables, assignments, loops and other control structures. Ex: Pure List, Haskell, XSLT
+ In a wider sense, FP means focusing on the functions. Ex: Lisp, Scheme, Racket, Clojure, Scala
+ Functions are first class citizens:
    - Functions can be defined anywhere, within other functions, etc.
    - Can be passed to functions as parameters and returned as results.
    - There are a set of operators that lets us compose functions.
