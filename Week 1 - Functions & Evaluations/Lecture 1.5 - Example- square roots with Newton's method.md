# Lecture 1.5 - Example: square roots with Newton's method

### Exercises
+ Write function `and(x, y)` such that `and(x, y) == x && y`

        def and(x: Boolean, y: Boolean): Boolean = {
          if (x) y else false
        }
    This would work fine if the second argument expression evaluates to a value. Will not work for `and(x, loop)`
    So the function signature should be   

        def and(x: Boolean, y: => Boolean): Boolean
+ Write function `or(x, y)` such that `pr(x, y) == x || y`

        def or(x: Boolean, y: Boolean): Boolean = {
          if (x) true else y
        }
+ Compute `sqrt(x)` using Newton's method:

        def abs(x: Double) = if (x > 0) x else -x
        def sqrt(x: Double): Double = {
        def sqrtIter(guess: Double): Double = {
          def isGoodEnough(guess: Double): Boolean = abs(guess * guess - x) < 0.001
          def improvedGuess(guess: Double): Double = (guess + x / guess) / 2
          if (isGoodEnough(guess)) guess
          else sqrtIter(improvedGuess(guess))
        }
        sqrtIter(1.0)
        }
        sqrt(2)
+ Notes:
    * Recursive functions in Scala must have a return type.
    * Functions that are necessary for another function can be nested within the main function to avoid namespace pollution.
