# Lecture 1.3 - Evaluation Strategies and Termination

### Evaluation strategies
+ Call by value
    * Interpreter reduces the function arguments to values before rewriting the function application.
    * Every function argument is evaluated exactly once.
+ Call by name
    * Interpreter applies function to unreduced arguments.
    * A function argument is not evaluated if it is unused in the function definition (evaluation of the function body).
+ Both strategies reduce to the same final value if:
    * The reduced expression consists of pure functions.
    * Both evaluations terminate.
    * If CBV of an expression evaluation terminates, its CBN evaluation terminates too. Other direction is not true.
        Example:

              def loop: Int = loop
              def first(x: Int, y: Int) = x
              first(1, loop)

        - Under Call by value, it tries to reduce the second parameter `loop` and gets into an infinite loop.
        - Under Call by name, the second parameter is not reduced at all since it is not used in the function definition.
+ Scala uses CBV. CBV does not involve repeated computation of the function arguments.
    * For expressions in general, Call by Value is exponentially faster in computation compared to CBN.
    * Avoids repeated computation of argument expressions.
    * Scala lets you force computation of an expression by using CBN. `=>` is used to achieve that.
            def firstImproved(x: Int, y: => Int) = x
    Here `y` is passed by name and not value. And infinite loop is avoided.
